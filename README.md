- 😺 Cat person all the way! My fluffy feline friend is the best company while coding.
- 📚 When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me with my nose buried in a good book. I am always looking for a great new read. Have any recommendations?
- 🌱 Lately, I've been getting my hands dirty with Node. Learning new technologies and building projects is my happy place.
- 🌿 On the flip side, I must admit that I'm terrible at growing plants. I've killed every houseplant I've ever owned. But hey, I can write some pretty solid code!
- ⚡ Fun fact: If I could have any superpower, it would be teleportation. 🦸‍ Imagine being able to be anywhere in the world in a snap!
